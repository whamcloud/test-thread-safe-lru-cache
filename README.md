# Thread-Safe LRU Cache

## Summary

You have been tasked with implementing a **thread-safe Least Recently Used (LRU)
cache** in Rust.

The cache will be accessed concurrently by multiple threads and must maintain
correct eviction behavior while providing efficient lookups and updates.

The goal is to design a cache that is **correct under concurrency**, has
**predictable memory usage**, and demonstrates sound engineering trade-offs.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality

* Fixed maximum capacity
* Store key–value pairs
* `get(key) -> Option<V>`
* `put(key, value)`
* Automatically evict the **least recently used** item when the cache exceeds
  its capacity

## Concurrency Requirements

* Must be safe for concurrent access by multiple threads
* Must support multiple readers and writers
* Must not deadlock
* Must maintain correctness under contention

## Performance Expectations

* Average **O(1)** time complexity for `get` and `put`
* Avoid unnecessary locking where possible
* Memory usage must remain bounded by the configured capacity

## Constraints

* Use only safe Rust
* Do not use global mutable state
* Blocking for extended periods is discouraged
* The cache must behave correctly under high contention

## Additional Requirements

* Your source should contain both unit and concurrency tests
* Tests should validate eviction behavior and thread safety
* All code must be formatted using the standard formatting tool
* Code must compile without clippy errors

## Design & Reasoning (Required)

Along with the code, include a document (for example `DESIGN.md`) explaining:

* Data structures used to implement the cache
* Synchronization strategy (e.g. mutexes, read-write locks)
* How LRU ordering is maintained under concurrency
* Trade-offs between simplicity, performance, and scalability
* Known limitations of the solution

Submissions without a design explanation will not be reviewed.

## Submission

Please fork this repository to your own GitHub account and submit a pull request
to your own repository.

Your pull request should include:

* A clear description of your approach
* Any assumptions or trade-offs made
* Instructions on how to run tests

A link to the pull request can be submitted once it is ready for review.

## Bonus

* Async-compatible version of the cache
* Configurable eviction policies
* Performance comparison of different locking strategies
* Sharded or lock-minimized implementation
